🧩 1. What is Blockchain and Ethereum?
Term	Meaning
Blockchain	A shared database (ledger) stored across many computers (nodes). Every new record (called a block) is linked to the previous one — so no one can secretly change history.
Ethereum	A popular blockchain that not only stores money (like Bitcoin) but also runs programs (smart contracts).
Smart Contract	A small computer program that lives on the blockchain. It runs automatically when someone interacts with it. It cannot be deleted or changed once deployed.
Test Network (Testnet)	A fake Ethereum network used for practice (e.g. Sepolia, Holesky). The ETH here has no real value.
🧠 2. What is Solidity?

Solidity is the programming language used to write smart contracts on Ethereum.

It looks similar to C++ / JavaScript.

The files end with .sol (for example Bank.sol).

A Solidity program (contract) has:

Pragma line → compiler version.

State variables → permanent data stored on blockchain.

Functions → the actions users can perform.

Visibility keywords → public, private, etc.

Special functions → constructor, fallback, receive.

🧮 3. Our Practical Aim

Assignment 3 – Bank Account Smart Contract

We want a mini-bank that lets a customer:

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Check their balance

Each customer is identified by their Ethereum address (like an account number).

💻 4. Full Code
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Bank {
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;

    // Deposit Ether into the bank
    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Send some Ether");
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    // Withdraw Ether from your account
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount > 0");
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient funds");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        (bool ok, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
        require(ok, "Transfer failed");
    }

    // Check your current balance
    function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[msg.sender];
    }
}

🧩 5. Line-by-Line Explanation
Line	Code	What It Does
1	// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT	A comment telling Remix the license type (optional for running).
2	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;	Use Solidity v0.8 or higher (safe math built in).
3	contract Bank {	Starts the contract named Bank. Think of it like a class.
4	mapping(address => uint256) private balances;	A mapping (like dictionary) that links each wallet address to their balance in wei.
5–8	function deposit() public payable { ... }	Allows anyone to send ETH to contract. msg.value is the amount sent. payable lets function receive ETH. The balance of sender increases.
9–15	function withdraw(uint256 amount)	Lets user withdraw ETH back. Checks: (1) amount > 0, (2) enough balance. Subtracts from mapping, then sends ETH back using call{value: amount}.
16–18	function getBalance()	Read-only (view) function; returns user’s current stored balance.
19	}	Ends contract.
⚙️ 6. How It Works on Remix

Open Remix IDE → https://remix.ethereum.org

Create new file → Bank.sol

Paste the code

Compile → click 🧱 Compiler (choose 0.8.x)

Deploy → Under Deploy & Run Transactions

Environment = Remix VM (Sandbox) or Injected Provider (MetaMask Testnet).

After deploying, buttons appear: deposit, withdraw, getBalance.

🧾 7. Inputs & Outputs
Action	Input You Give	Output You See	What Happens
Deposit	In Remix “Value” field → e.g. 0.1 ether	No text; state changes	0.1 ETH added to your on-chain balance
Withdraw	Call withdraw(10000000000000000) (= 0.01 ETH)	No text; wallet receives ETH	ETH sent back to your account
Get Balance	Click button (no input)	Returns number in wei (e.g. 100000000000000000)	That equals 0.1 ETH
⛽ 8. Gas & Transaction Fee

Every transaction that changes blockchain state (deposit/withdraw) uses gas.

Reading data (getBalance) is free off-chain.

Gas Used × Gas Price = Transaction Fee.

You can see these values in Remix console or Etherscan (for testnet).

🎤 9. Viva Quick Answers
Question	Short Answer
What is Solidity?	A language to write smart contracts on Ethereum.
What is a Smart Contract?	Code that runs automatically on the blockchain when called.
What is msg.sender?	The address (account) that called the function.
What is msg.value?	The amount of Ether (in wei) sent with the transaction.
Why payable?	It allows the function to receive Ether.
What is a mapping?	Key-value store; here it maps each address to its balance.
Why require?	To check conditions and stop execution if false.
What is gas?	A fee paid for running computations on the blockchain.
🧠 10. Simple Flow

1️⃣ User deploys contract.
2️⃣ User calls deposit() and sends Ether.
3️⃣ Contract stores balance under user’s address.
4️⃣ User calls getBalance() to check it.
5️⃣ User calls withdraw(amount) to get money back.
6️⃣ Ethereum network records all these transactions publicly.
