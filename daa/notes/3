🧩 Step 1: Input Data
weights = [10, 20, 30]
profits = [60, 100, 120]
capacity = 50  # total capacity M


weights → list of each item’s weight.

profits → list of each item’s profit/value.

capacity (M) → the total weight limit your knapsack can carry (50 units).

So we have:

Item	Weight	Profit
1	10	60
2	20	100
3	30	120
🧩 Step 2: Combine all items into one list
items = []
for i in range(len(weights)):
    ratio = profits[i] / weights[i]
    items.append((profits[i], weights[i], ratio))


Let’s go word by word:

items = []

Create an empty list to store all items together (profit, weight, ratio).

for i in range(len(weights))

Loops through each index i (0, 1, 2) for all items.

ratio = profits[i] / weights[i]

Calculate profit per unit weight (value density).

Example:

Item 1: 60/10 = 6.0

Item 2: 100/20 = 5.0

Item 3: 120/30 = 4.0

items.append((profits[i], weights[i], ratio))

Add a tuple (profit, weight, ratio) to the list.

After loop:

items = [
    (60, 10, 6.0),
    (100, 20, 5.0),
    (120, 30, 4.0)
]

🧩 Step 3: Sort items by ratio (descending order)
items.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)


✅ As explained earlier:

key=lambda x: x[2] → Sort by the 3rd value (ratio).

reverse=True → Highest ratio first.

Since 6.0 > 5.0 > 4.0, order remains the same here.

🧩 Step 4: Initialize profit and remaining capacity
P = 0  # total profit
M = capacity


P keeps track of the total profit earned.

M is how much capacity is still left.

Initially:

P = 0
M = 50

🧩 Step 5: Pick items greedily
for profit, weight, ratio in items:
    if M > 0 and weight <= M:
        M = M - weight
        P = P + profit
    else:
        break


Let’s dry run 👇

🔹 First item → (60, 10, 6.0)

M = 50, weight = 10, so fits fully ✅

M = 50 - 10 = 40

P = 0 + 60 = 60

🔹 Second item → (100, 20, 5.0)

M = 40, weight = 20, fits ✅

M = 40 - 20 = 20

P = 60 + 100 = 160

🔹 Third item → (120, 30, 4.0)

M = 20, but weight = 30, doesn’t fully fit ❌

So we go to fractional part after the loop.

🧩 Step 6: Take fractional part if capacity left
if M > 0:
    P = P + profit * (M / weight)


profit = 120, weight = 30, M = 20

Fraction taken = 20 / 30 = 0.6667

Fractional profit = 120 * 0.6667 = 80

Add to total:
P = 160 + 80 = 240

🧩 Step 7: Final Output
print("Maximum Profit =", P)


✅ Output:

Maximum Profit = 240.0

🧠 Summary of Concept
Item	Weight	Profit	Ratio	Taken
1	10	60	6.0	full
2	20	100	5.0	full
3	30	120	4.0	20/30 = 2/3
Total				Profit = 240
