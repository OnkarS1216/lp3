🧩 Problem Idea

We have to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that:

No two queens attack each other.

Queens attack along rows, columns, and diagonals.

🧱 Code Explanation (Every Line)
def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(" ".join(row))
    print()


Purpose: Prints the chessboard nicely.

board is a 2D list (like a matrix) made of "." (empty) and "Q" (queen).

" ".join(row) joins all elements of the row with spaces.

Example: ["Q", ".", ".", "."] → "Q . . ."

def is_safe(board, row, col, n):


Checks if a queen can be safely placed at position (row, col).

🧩 Step-by-step inside is_safe
    # check column
    for i in range(row):
        if board[i][col] == "Q":
            return False


Looks vertically up in the same column.

If any previous row already has a "Q" in the same column → return False.

    # check left diagonal
    i, j = row - 1, col - 1
    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        if board[i][j] == "Q":
            return False
        i -= 1
        j -= 1


Checks the upper-left diagonal.

Moves diagonally up and left (↖).

If it finds any "Q" → not safe.

    # check right diagonal
    i, j = row - 1, col + 1
    while i >= 0 and j < n:
        if board[i][j] == "Q":
            return False
        i -= 1
        j += 1


Checks the upper-right diagonal (↗).

Same logic: if any "Q" found → not safe.

    return True


If no queen conflicts found → the spot is safe.

def solve_n_queens(board, row, n):


Recursive function that tries to place queens row by row.

Base idea: Place one queen in each row safely using recursion.

Inside solve_n_queens
    if row == n:
        print_board(board)
        return


Base case: If we have reached past the last row, all queens are placed → print board (solution found).

    for col in range(n):
        if is_safe(board, row, col, n):
            board[row][col] = "Q"
            solve_n_queens(board, row + 1, n)
            board[row][col] = "."


Loops through each column in current row.

If (row, col) is safe:

Place queen ("Q").

Move to next row (row+1) → recursion.

When done, remove queen (".") → backtracking step (try next position).

n = 4
board = [["."] * n for _ in range(n)]
board[0][1] = "Q"  # first queen placed
print("Initial Board:")
print_board(board)
print("Solutions:")
solve_n_queens(board, 1, n)


Creates a 4×4 empty board.

Puts one queen manually at row 0, column 1.

Prints initial board.

Calls solver starting from row 1 (since first row is filled).

🧮 Dry Run (n = 4)
Initial board
. Q . .
. . . .
. . . .
. . . .

Step 1 → Start at row 1

Try all columns one by one.

Column	Safe?	Action
0	❌ (same diagonal as first Q)	skip
1	❌ (same column)	skip
2	✅ safe	place Q
3	❌ (same diagonal)	skip

Board becomes:

. Q . .
. . Q .
. . . .
. . . .

Step 2 → row 2

Try each column:

Col	Safe?	Action
0	✅ safe	place Q
others	later checked after backtracking	

Board:

. Q . .
. . Q .
Q . . .
. . . .

Step 3 → row 3

Try each column:

Col	Safe?
0	❌ same column
1	❌ diagonal
2	❌ column conflict
3	✅ safe

Board:

. Q . .
. . Q .
Q . . .
. . . Q


✅ Solution 1 found!

Printed board:

. Q . .
. . Q .
Q . . .
. . . Q


Now backtrack — remove last queen and try other positions for previous rows.

Step 4 → Backtracking

Remove the last queen and try next columns in row 2 and row 1 until another valid configuration is found.

Eventually, the program finds the second valid solution:

. Q . .
. . . Q
Q . . .
. . Q .


✅ Final Output:

Initial Board:
. Q . .
. . . .
. . . .
. . . .

Solutions:
. Q . .
. . Q .
Q . . .
. . . Q

. Q . .
. . . Q

. . Q .

🔁 What’s Happening in Simple Terms

1️⃣ Try placing a queen in each row, one per row.
2️⃣ If it’s safe → move to next row.
3️⃣ If you can’t place anywhere → go back to previous row and try a new spot (backtracking).
4️⃣ Continue until all queens are placed.

💡 Key Concepts Learned
Concept	Meaning
Backtracking	Trying all possibilities step by step, and going back if a path fails.
Recursive Function	Function calling itself to handle smaller parts of the same problem.
Base Case	When all rows are filled — print solution.
is_safe()	Prevents attacking queens (same column or diagonals).
